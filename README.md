The idea of geometric typefaces with a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile family by 
Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).

Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the intension to perform well on screen starting from low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical 
and diagonal cuts have a 45Â° angle, outlines are rounded.

Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression.

Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the 
old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.

Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions 
Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.

Iceland is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.
